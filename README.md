### week02
#### First parse of address only
This assignment required us to start parsing just the address for every meeting in our zone. My zone was zone 4.

[Assignment 2](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_02.md)

### week03
#### Google Maps API / async
This assignment required us to use the Google Maps API to get the latitude and longitude of the street addresses we parsed last week.

[Assignment 3](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_03.md)

### week04
#### Data Model + MongoDB intro
This assignment required us to sketch a data model for the AA meetings data and then write code to upload our data into MongoDB.

[Assignment 4](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_04.md)

### week05/06
#### Full Parse + MongoDB (Tues + 7p)
This assignment required us to finish parsing the rest of our data (time, notes, wheelchair, etc.) and then use the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to write a query/aggregation to find meetings that begin on Tuesday at or after 7:00pm.

[Assignment 5/6](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_0506.md)

### week07 *not included*
#### Sensors
The assignment required us to build our Particle Photon sensors. I was given the tilt ball and IR sensor.

### week08
#### PostgreSQL
This assignment required us to use PostgreSQL to manually insert tables using SQL correlated to our sensor data.

[Assignment 8](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_08.md)

[PostgreSQL setup](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_08_documentation.md)

### week09
#### EC2 Instance
This assignment required us to write code that will insert our sensor data into our EC2 instance.

[Assignment 9](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_09.md)

[EC2 Instance in AWS setup](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_09_documentation.md)

### week10
#### PM2
This assignment required us to use Express and PM2 to run a script that will query the AWS database with our sensor data and display the data on a given link (endpoint) in my EC2 instance.

[Assignment 10](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_10.md)

### finalOne
#### AA Meetings
Final Assignment 1 required us to use our parsed AA meeting data and have it correspond to Google Maps, displaying the data in markers and geographically placing the markers by the latLong.

[Final Assignment 1](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/final_assignment_1.md)

### finalTwo
#### Sensors
Final Assignment 2 required us to write SQL queries that could provide data from our sensors that would correspond with a sketch of a visualization for the UI/UX displaying the data collected over the month+.
